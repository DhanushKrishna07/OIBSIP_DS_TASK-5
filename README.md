This is task 5 of Oasis Infobyte | Data Science Domain.

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

ðŸ“ŠSales Prediction Using PythonðŸ“ˆ

Delving into advertising data to predict future sales with linear regression, ridge, and lasso models. This project demonstrates the significance of outliers and model optimization using GridSearchCV. 

Project Highlights:

â€¢Explored and cleaned advertising dataset
â€¢Visualized data distribution and outliers
â€¢Implemented and evaluated linear regression, ridge, and lasso models
â€¢Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Steps Involved:

â€¢Loaded and inspected the advertising dataset.
â€¢Performed exploratory data analysis including descriptive statistics, null values, and duplicates.
â€¢Visualized data using box plots and scatter plots to identify relationships and outliers.
â€¢Split the data into training and testing sets.
â€¢Implemented a linear regression model and evaluated its performance using metrics like MSE, MAE, and RÂ².
â€¢Used GridSearchCV to optimize the linear regression model's parameters.
â€¢Applied ridge and lasso regression models, including hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
â€¢Compared the performance of all models on the test set.

Key Takeaway:

ðŸ”‘Effective advertising strategies significantly impact sales predictions. The project highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning in improving model performance and demonstrates the critical role of outliers in predicting sales accurately.ðŸ’¡
